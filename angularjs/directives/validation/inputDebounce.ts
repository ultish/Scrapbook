         * This directive delays the update to the model by 550ms for the default, and also
         * updates on blur immediately. Because of the delayed update, it also binds to the
         * 'enter' key to update the model immediately so validation on the form can work
         *
         * Important:
         * - the form must use ng-submit. eg <form ng-submit=""> for enter key and validation to work
         * - place form validation on the ng-submit. eg <form ng-submit="form.$valid && ctrl.save(form)">
         *
         * Any pending changes take place immediately when the form is submitted via the submit event.
         * ngClick events will occur before the model is updated so use ng-submit instead.
         * As the update model is debounced, validators aren't executed until the debounce is done, or the
         * form is submitted. So ng-disabled="form.$invalid" doesn't work for disabling the submit button.
         * Instead we use ng-submit="form.$valid && ctrl.save(form)" which will prevent invalid values
         * from being submitted.
